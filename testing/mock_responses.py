    "Explanation": "The large spiked ball is relatively robust, justifying a moderate HP of 4, and it has significant attack potential with an AD of 5 due to its spiky nature. However, it is heavy and not very mobile, resulting in a low movement speed of 1. It is defense-oriented, as it would likely stay near a base or in a protective role. There are no clear strengths or weaknesses against other characters, as the ball's physical nature does not indicate any particular advantages or disadvantages against likely opponents.",
